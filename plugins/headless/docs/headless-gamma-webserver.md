## Headless Gamma - Web server API

This document presents how to 

 1. start the web server of the Headless Gamma, and
 2. use the requests and the API.

## Webserver functioning

This section details how the webserver functions.

Upon successfully starting the server, a green colored _"Headless Gamma OpenAPI server is running."_  message should appear.

The server periodically checks if there are operations running, and logs the process of requests received.

It is important to note that a workspace can have _only one_ instance of a project with the same name. To import a second version of the same project, it has to be renamed. There can be _only one_ operation running on a particular project at a given time.

## Webserver API

This section details the API used to communicatie with the webserver.

  - **POST**
	- **addProject** `/gamma/workspace/{workspace}/project` - Adds a project to the specified workspace. The request body is a multipart/form-data type body, which has a `file` field, where the zip file containing the project must be provided (examples of this can be found in the _Example: Workflow with Docker_ section). (Alternatively, in Postman, the file can be selected from the file system). The zip file must have the same name as the project. As an example, the `hu.bme.mit.gamma.test` project should be placed in `hu.bme.mit.gamma.test.zip`.
	- **getResult** `/gamma/workspace/{workspace}/project/{project}` - Gets specified files and folders from the project found in the given workspace and zips them. The files and/or folders should be specified as raw data in the request body, specifying the relative paths from the project root, as `files`. Example: `"files":["src-gen","test-gen","trace/ExecutionTrace0.get"]`. If the given file or folder does not exists, it will not appear in the zip file (the request doesn't throw an exception).
	- **addWorkspace** `/gamma/workspace` - Creates a workspace in the location specified in `config.properties` (set to `hu.bme.mit.gamma.headless.server/workspaces` by default). Returns with the name (ID) of the workspace, which is used in further requests.
	-  **runCommand** `/gamma/workspace/{workspace}/project/{project}/run` - Starts an operation in the specified workspace and project, based on a `.ggen` file. The parameters are the following: 
		- `workspace` specifies the workspace,
		- `project` specifies the project, and
		- `filePath` specifies the path of the `.ggen` file found in the project. Note that `filePath` isn't a path parameter, and it should be specified in the request body, which is a multipart/form-data type body. The path in `filePath` should use  `/`  characters. Example: `model/test/Test.ggen`.
	- **stopProcess** `/gamma/workspace/{workspace}/project/{project}/stop` - Stops the currently ongoing process in the project found in the given workspace.
  - **PUT**
	 - **setLogLevel** `/gamma/log/level` - Sets the verbosity of the logger for both the webserver and the Headless Gamma. The level should be set in the `level` field of the request body, as multipart/form-data request. The accepted levels are `Info`, `Warning`, `Severe` and `Off`. 
	 - **logToFile** `/gamma/log/file` - Toggles between enabling and disabling logging to file. By default, logging to file is disabled. Note that re-enabling logging to file (after a disabling it) will overwrite the previous contents of the log file. An example of usage would be: creating workspace, adding project, enabling logging to file, running command, disabling logging to file and getting results (and optionally, deleting the project and workspace).
 - **GET**
	- **list** `/gamma/workspace/{workspace}/project/{project}` - Lists all files found in the project in the given workspace.
	- **status** `/gamma/workspace/{workspace}/project/{project}/status` -  Gets the status of the project in the given workspace. It returns with a simple text, indicating the status of the project: `Done`, `Ready` or `Failure`.
	- **getLogs** `/gamma/workspace/{workspace}/logs` - Retrieves the logs of a workspace. This can be saved as a text file. These logs contain error messages regarding crashes of the headless Eclipse (usually the last error message is the direct cause of the crash).
	- **getHeadlessLogs** `/gamma/log/file` - Retrieves the logs of the Headless Gamma, if logging to file was enabled. This can be saved as a text file. Note that this request works only if logging to file is disabled when requesting, to avoid consistency issues. These logs are can be seen on the terminal as well, and display the operation status of the server and the current steps of ongoing operations.
 - **DELETE**
	- **deleteProject** `/gamma/workspace/{workspace}/project/{project}` Deletes the project from the project in the given workspace.
	- **deleteWorkspace** `/gamma/workspace/{workspace}` - Deletes the given workspace if it exists and is empty.
